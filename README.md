Got it 👍 — you want **just the professional `README.md`** for your project.
Here’s the final polished version you can copy directly into your repo:

# 🧬 Cancer Detection using Machine Learning (Python)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This project demonstrates a **machine learning pipeline** for cancer detection using the **scikit-learn breast cancer dataset**.  
It includes scripts to train a model, evaluate it, and make predictions.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and splitting  
- Training multiple machine learning models  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Saving and loading trained models with `joblib`  
- Simple prediction script for new samples  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Command Line  

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cancer-detection-ml

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Train a model

```bash
python src/train.py --output models/model.joblib
```

### Make predictions

```bash
python src/predict.py --model models/model.joblib
```

---

## 📊 Expected Output

See [`cancer_detection_ml_with_output.pdf`](cancer_detection_ml_with_output.pdf) for example training and prediction results.

# 🧬 Cancer Detection using Machine Learning (Python)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This project demonstrates a **machine learning pipeline** for cancer detection using the **scikit-learn breast cancer dataset**.  
It includes scripts to train a model, evaluate it, and make predictions.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and splitting  
- Training multiple machine learning models  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Saving and loading trained models with `joblib`  
- Simple prediction script for new samples  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Command Line  

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cancer-detection-ml

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Train a model

```bash
python src/train.py --output models/model.joblib
```

### Make predictions

```bash
python src/predict.py --model models/model.joblib
```

## 📊 Datasets

This project can be run with either:

1. **Built-in scikit-learn dataset**

   * `load_breast_cancer()` (569 samples, 30 features)
   * Recommended for quick testing

2. **Kaggle dataset (optional, real-world data)**

   * [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
   * Download the CSV and place it in `dataset/breast_cancer.csv`
   * The training script can be modified to use it

---

## 📊 Expected Output

See [`cancer_detection_ml_with_output.pdf`](cancer_detection_ml_with_output.pdf) for example training and prediction results.

✅ This is a **complete, professional README.md** that GitHub will render beautifully.  

Would you like me to also add a **Mermaid flow diagram** (dataset → training → evaluation → prediction) inside this README so it’s more visually engaging?
